# Reliable UDP

Reliable UDP refers to implementations of the User Datagram Protocol (UDP) that provide some or all of the reliability features typically associated with the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), such as:

1. Guaranteed delivery: Ensuring that all sent packets reach the destination.
2. In-order delivery: Delivering packets to the application in the same order they were sent.
3. Congestion control: Adapting the sending rate to avoid overwhelming the network.
4. Flow control: Ensuring the sender doesn't send data faster than the receiver can handle it.   

## How is it implemented?

Reliable UDP is typically implemented as a library or a layer on top of the standard UDP protocol.  This additional layer adds the necessary features to ensure reliable transmission. Key techniques used in such implementations include:   

Acknowledgements (ACKs): The receiver sends back ACK packets to the sender to confirm receipt of data. The sender can then retransmit any unacknowledged packets.
Sequence numbers: Packets are assigned sequence numbers so the receiver can reassemble them in the correct order and detect duplicates.
Timers and retransmission: The sender maintains timers for each sent packet. If an ACK is not received within a timeout period, the packet is retransmitted.
Congestion control algorithms: These algorithms dynamically adjust the sending rate based on network conditions to avoid congestion.
Flow control mechanisms: These mechanisms ensure the sender doesn't overwhelm the receiver by limiting the amount of unacknowledged data.
Example implementations:

RUDP (Reliable UDP): A transport layer protocol designed for the Plan 9 operating system.   
Enet: A reliable UDP networking library commonly used in game development.   
UDT (UDP-based Data Transfer Protocol): A protocol designed for high-performance data transfer over wide area networks.   
QUIC: A newer transport protocol that provides reliable, multiplexed connections over UDP.   
When to use Reliable UDP:

## Reliable UDP is often considered in scenarios where:

1. Low latency is crucial: UDP's lack of connection setup and minimal overhead can be advantageous in applications requiring real-time communication.   
Packet loss is tolerable: Some applications can handle occasional packet loss, making TCP's strict reliability guarantees unnecessary.
Multicast is required: Reliable UDP is sometimes used for multicast communication, where TCP's point-to-point nature is not suitable.
Key considerations:

2. Complexity: Implementing reliable UDP adds complexity compared to using standard UDP or TCP.
Overhead: The additional mechanisms for reliability can introduce some overhead in terms of bandwidth and processing.
Performance: The performance of reliable UDP implementations can vary depending on the specific algorithms and network conditions.
In conclusion, reliable UDP offers a way to add reliability features to the UDP protocol, making it suitable for a wider range of applications. However, it's important to carefully consider the trade-offs between complexity, overhead, and performance when choosing between reliable UDP, standard UDP, and TCP.


## how is reliable udp used in stock exchange system design


Reliable UDP is used in stock exchange system design primarily for market data dissemination. This involves broadcasting real-time information about stock prices, trades, and other market events to a large number of subscribers.   

Key reasons for using Reliable UDP:

Low latency: UDP's lack of connection setup and minimal overhead provides the low-latency communication crucial for high-frequency trading and other time-sensitive applications in the stock market.   
Multicast support: UDP natively supports multicast, allowing a single transmission to reach numerous subscribers simultaneously, which is ideal for market data distribution.   
Tolerance for packet loss: Market data feeds often involve a high volume of updates, and some level of packet loss can be tolerated. Reliable UDP mechanisms can help recover lost packets, but they also allow the system to continue operating even if a few updates are missed.
How Reliable UDP is used:

Market data feeds: The exchange broadcasts market data using multicast UDP.   
Reliable UDP library: Subscribers use a reliable UDP library or protocol implementation to receive the data.
Packet loss recovery: The library uses techniques like ACKs, sequence numbers, and retransmission to ensure reliable delivery and in-order processing of market data packets.
Application processing: The subscriber application processes the received market data, updating its internal state and potentially making trading decisions based on the latest information.
Additional considerations:

Congestion control: While UDP itself doesn't provide congestion control, a well-designed reliable UDP implementation might include mechanisms to avoid overwhelming the network.
Flow control: Ensuring that subscribers can keep up with the high volume of market data is essential. Flow control mechanisms might be used to throttle the sender or allow subscribers to request retransmission of missed data.
Security: Reliable UDP implementations often include security measures like encryption and authentication to protect the integrity and confidentiality of market data.
Key benefits:

High performance: Reliable UDP allows for the low-latency and high-throughput delivery of market data, essential for modern trading strategies.
Scalability: Multicast UDP and the ability to tolerate some packet loss make it easier to scale the system to support a large number of subscribers.
Flexibility: Reliable UDP implementations can be tailored to specific requirements, allowing for fine-grained control over reliability, latency, and overhead.
Conclusion:


## How does reliable udp ensures packet loss recovery in stock exchange system design


Reliable UDP ensures packet loss recovery in stock exchange system design primarily through the following mechanisms:

Acknowledgements (ACKs):
The receiver sends back acknowledgment packets (ACKs) to the sender to confirm the successful receipt of data packets.
The sender maintains a record of sent packets and expects an ACK for each one.
If an ACK is not received within a specified timeout period, the sender assumes the packet was lost and retransmits it.

Sequence numbers:
Each data packet is assigned a unique sequence number.
The receiver uses these sequence numbers to:
Reassemble packets in the correct order if they arrive out of order.
Detect duplicate packets and discard them.
Identify missing packets and request their retransmission through negative acknowledgments (NACKs) or by not acknowledging a specific sequence number, prompting the sender to retransmit it.

Timers and Retransmission:
The sender maintains timers for each unacknowledged packet.
If an ACK is not received within the timeout period, the packet is assumed lost, and the sender retransmits it.
The timeout values are dynamically adjusted based on network conditions to balance efficiency and responsiveness.

Negative Acknowledgements (NACKs):
In some implementations, the receiver may explicitly send NACKs to the sender to request retransmission of specific missing packets.
This can be more efficient than relying solely on timeouts and missing ACKs.
Forward Error Correction (FEC):
While not always used, FEC can be employed to add redundancy to the data stream, allowing the receiver to recover some lost packets without retransmission.
This can be particularly useful in environments with high packet loss rates but comes at the cost of increased bandwidth usage.
How these mechanisms work together in a stock exchange system:

The exchange sends market data packets with sequence numbers to subscribers using multicast UDP.
Subscribers use a reliable UDP library to receive and process these packets.
The library tracks received sequence numbers, sends ACKs for received packets, and may send NACKs or rely on timeouts to request retransmission of lost packets.
The sender (exchange) retransmits any lost packets based on the feedback from subscribers.
The library at the subscriber end reassembles the packets in the correct order and delivers them to the application for processing.
Key benefits of these mechanisms in stock exchange systems:

Ensure reliable delivery of critical market data: Packet loss recovery mechanisms ensure that subscribers receive all market data updates, enabling them to make informed trading decisions.
Maintain data integrity and order: Sequence numbers and reassembly ensure that market data is processed in the correct order, preventing inconsistencies and errors.
Adapt to network conditions: Dynamic timeouts and congestion control mechanisms help the system adapt to varying network conditions and maintain performance even during periods of high packet loss or congestion.
In conclusion, reliable UDP implementations employ a combination of ACKs, sequence numbers, timers, retransmission, and potentially NACKs or FEC to provide robust packet loss recovery in stock exchange systems. This ensures the reliable and timely delivery of critical market data, which is essential for the efficient functioning of the financial markets.

## If reliable udp also uses ACK, how is it different from TCP?


While both Reliable UDP and TCP use ACKs (acknowledgements) for ensuring data delivery, there are several key differences that distinguish them:

1. Connection Establishment

TCP: Requires a three-way handshake to establish a connection before data transfer can begin. This adds latency but provides reliable connection setup and teardown.
Reliable 
UDP: Typically does not require a connection establishment phase. This reduces latency but might necessitate additional mechanisms for handling connection initiation and termination.

2. Reliability Guarantees:

TCP: Provides strong reliability guarantees, including in-order delivery, guaranteed delivery, and congestion control. This makes it ideal for applications that require absolute data integrity.
Reliable 
UDP: Offers varying levels of reliability depending on the specific implementation. Some may provide in-order delivery and congestion control, while others may focus primarily on packet loss recovery. This flexibility allows for tailoring the protocol to specific application needs, potentially sacrificing some reliability for improved performance in certain scenarios.

3. Overhead:

TCP: Has a higher overhead due to connection establishment, state maintenance, and complex reliability mechanisms. This can impact performance, especially in low-latency or high-throughput applications.
Reliable 
UDP: Generally has lower overhead compared to TCP, as it avoids connection establishment and can implement simpler reliability mechanisms. This can lead to improved performance in certain cases.

4. Congestion Control:

TCP: Implements sophisticated congestion control algorithms to avoid network congestion and ensure fair sharing of network resources.
Reliable 
UDP: May or may not implement congestion control, depending on the specific implementation. Some implementations might use simpler congestion control mechanisms or rely on application-level control.

5. Application-level Control:

TCP: Provides a standardized and well-defined interface for applications, abstracting many complexities of network communication.
Reliable 
UDP: Often requires more application-level involvement in managing reliability, flow control, and congestion control. This gives developers more flexibility but also increases complexity.
In summary:

Both Reliable UDP and TCP use ACKs for ensuring data delivery.
TCP offers strong reliability guarantees and a standardized interface but has higher overhead.
Reliable UDP provides more flexibility and potentially lower overhead but may require more application-level involvement and offer varying levels of reliability depending on the implementation.
The choice between Reliable UDP and TCP depends on the specific application requirements and trade-offs between reliability, performance, and complexity.
