# Ethereum and Smart Contracts

## Introduction to Cryptocurrency

- Any currency in digital or virtual form using crpyograpgy for security.
- Decentralized.
- Whitepaper : A document that expains the technology and purpose behind a cryptocurrency.
- ICO : Initial coin offering. This is just like IPO.
- Fiat Currency: A traditional government issued currency which exists physically. A fiat currency is not tied to gold. Government control their circulation.
- Fiat currency is backed only by the faith of the government.

## Bitcoin Facts

- Bitcoin can only be used for decentralized finance.
- Bitcoin is the first cryptocurrency. It is referred as digital gold.
- Bitcoin is Turing incomplete - You can only do limited stuff on it.


## What is Turing Completeness ? 
- All modern programming languages like C, C++, JS are turing complete.
- For a language to be turing complete it should be able to do anything that a Turing machine can do.
- A Turing machine is an endlessly long piece of tape that has a read/write head. It can read/write 0's and 1's in the cell on the tap. This allows anything to be computed.
- Turing Machine requirementss
    - Must be able to perform conditional branching - must have if else block.
    - Can express any possible program - loops, infinite loops, while loop.
    - You cannot predict or prove the final state of a Turing complete language.

## Introduction to Ethereum

- Turing Complete
- Does not only provide decentralized finance. It is considered a decentralized development platform.
- Allows development and usage of decentralized apps with the use of the native ether token.
- Has a programming language called Solidity that allows you to write code(smart contracts) that are hosted on the blockchain.
- Smart contract allows programs to be decentralized.
- Now you can decentralize games, autctions, currency and much more using smart contracts.

## Smart Contracts
- programs that are stored on the blockchain and get executed when some predetermined condition is met.
- Used to automate the execution of an agreement.
- Properties of smart contracts 
    - Immutable
    - Transparent or public
    - Executed by nodes on network
    - cost money to deploy
    - Can hold a balance, just like regular address.
- Can only run when provided a gas.
- you cannot have an infinite loop running in a smart contract.
- All operations are traceable and immutable
- Cannot make HTTP requests or reply on any data outside of the blockchain.
- DApps are made up of one or more smart contracts.
- Smart contract is stored inside the block of a blockchain.
- You have to pay a fee then only the block would be picked up by validators to be added to the blockchain.

## DApps Examples
- Auctions
- Games
- Sale of Assets
- Decentralized Exchanges(Uniswap, pancakeSwap)
- Web Browsers (brave)
- Credit Services (MakerDAO)
- DAOs (Decentralized Autonomous Organizations) - Governance systems which are decentralized.

## Why use a decentralized application ? 
- If I know it a gambling machine, a decentralized machine would be better because I know that no one can mess with the machine and decrease my odds of winning. I can look at the code and check whether the machine is fair or not.
- No need of real estate agents.
- No need of lawyers.
