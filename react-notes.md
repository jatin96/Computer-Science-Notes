# React Notes

## What is a single page application ? 

Usually, when you hit a url you are served the index.html file, which is the root of the application. This file contains 
- html code
- css
- javascript

Now, when you hit the about page in the same website, you would be served about.html. 

Servering new html page files multiple times slows down the front-end. To make it fast, react router intelligently manages different elements on the index.html file based on conditions and url. Due to this, only index.html files is served to the front-end. This is why it is said that react is used to build single page applications.

## What is lazy loading ?

In react, only those parts of the code are rendered which you see on the screen. This is called lazy loading

## Why we use React ? 

- Reusable components

## package.json vs package-lock.json

package-lock.json file is automatically generated by react and managed by npm. This file fixes the versions of the dependencies you use right now so that when you run the app in future, it runs smoothly. You don't make any changes to package-lock.json file. You do an npm upgrade or npm update and that is how you update the package.

## npx

npx means you don't install the package in your local. You just download it, use it and then delete it.

## Dev dependencies

Dev dependencies are not bundled in the production bundle. These are only used by developers to aid in development. It is not included in production to save space.

## npm install -g

You should ideally never use -g flag because it installs packages in your system in global scope so that many react projects can use it. It should not be used because even if you package.json file doesn't contain the dependency you need, it will get imported if it was installed in global scope. If someone else will install the package.json file, then he would realize some dependencies are missing.

## Versioning

major.minor.patch 
- ^ upgrade only minor and patch

## JSX

This is the engine used by react to render your app.

## Virtual DOM

React works on the princple of virtual doms. A virtual DOM is an exact replica of the original DOM. React makes changes to the virtual DOM. Then, the virtual DOM is diffed with the original DOM and only those nodes are updated which have changed.

## let vs const

- let is used for variables that can change
- const is used for variables which cannot be changed

## Spread operator

spread operator flats and adds the properties or elements into another object.

eg

```js
const arr = [1, 2, 3, 4];
const arr1 = [0, ...arr]
console.log(arr1) // output: [0,1,2,3,4]
```

## Unique keys while looping any element

Whenever you are looping over any element in javascript using foreach or map, you need to pass a unique key to JSX so that react can track that element in the virtual dom.

```js
names.map((name, index) => {
return <Card key={`${name}-${index}`} name={name} />
}
```
